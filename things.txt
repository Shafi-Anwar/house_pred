first import all libs
then convert data in df
choose one algo(RF)
traintest split
fit and check r2_score for this rf
then check linear regression score 
lin_reg score < RF score
to make RF more better add fine tuning of parameters, updating n_estimators etc.., and seeing the change in results
before rf score:0.77, after tuning 0.79
now feature engineering
after adding new features, re-train the model and see metrics, they may increase 0.02
after that check feature importance,which feature the model is using/considering the most, by creating df of feature_importances_df
plot a graph of feat importance

Next-final thing is Error analysis

create a df in which there are only columns that are required for getting residuals/Error
Actualprice,predicted_price, error,absolute_eror,medincome
now!, new feature is added income per occupant = medincome/averageoccupants
retrain the model 
now the mse:0.37 and R2 score is 0.79! two 0.02 increment 
but when we tuned by updating n-estimators the r2 was 0.79(idc)
BUT BIGGG BUGG!!
500k actual price and predicted_price is 200k? error is 300k!!!
and 160k house ko 350k predict! 
bhot bada error
HERE COMES NEW CONCEPT CALLED LOG
Learning......
Log makes the scale small
1.0 - log(0)
2.0 - 0.69
3.0 - 1.10
4.0 - 1.39
5.0 - 1.61
new model in Log 
r2 score: 0.8434921197352481
MAE_log: 0.09631234761077569
MAE ($): 0.30635713273574855
RMSE ($): 0.5534953773390963
serious IMPROVEMENT!! 79% to 84% r2 score and mae is also decreased to 9%
converted the prices to dollars
Now ipynb to .py time, time for creating a flask api
created streamlit app used api in the application
Successfully predicted the price for given data
